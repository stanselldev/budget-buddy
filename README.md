# budget-buddy

Simple budgeting application built with Meteor and React.  

It combines the task of balancing a checkbook and adding all of your bills and miscellaneous expenses displaying the ending balance afterwards.

Features to implement:
1. Differentiate credits vs. debits when adding finances (implemented but needs to be cleaned up.  No commit yet)
2. Profile page where you can add a "Bill Book" to store all your bills to pre-fill (Profile page implemented. No commit yet)
3. Family plan implementation to share a budget with others in your family (mostly to implement many-to-many for project requirements)
